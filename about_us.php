                            happen.</h3>
                        <p>We’re a diverse collective of thinkers and doers, continuously reimagining our products and
                            practices to help people do
                            what they love in new ways. That innovation is inspired by a shared commitment to great work
                            — and to each other.
                            Because learning from the people here means we’re learning from the best. </p>
                        <h3 style="color:orange;" class="color">Come work where sentences start with “What if…?”</h3>
                        <p>Everyone here is an innovator, or an innovator-to-be. That’s how we create the kinds of
                            products and experiences that
                            few ever imagine. For example, engineers here developed frameworks that have transformed the
                            speed and accuracy of
                            medical research. Others figured out how people in wheelchairs can track their activity with
                            Apple Watch to promote
                            their fitness. Our retail teams revolutionized the industry by reinventing the entire
                            customer experience. And each day
                            at lunch, the environmentally friendly pizza box patented by a chef in our café reminds us
                            that innovation comes from
                            everyone in every role at Apple. </p>

                        <h4 style="color:blue">1971: The Beginning&#45;</h4>
                        <p>Co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak first met when they were 20 years old through a
                            mutual friend, Bill Fernandez —
                            who became Apple's first employee.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 style="color:blue">1976: Launch&#45;</h4>
                        <p> Jobs and Wozniak officially founded Apple Computers, Inc. and unveiled the Apple I. They
                            hand-build 50 Apple I's and
                            decided to sell them for $666.66. The vintage computer only had 4KB of RAM, which is
                            2,000,000 times less than a
                            standard computer today.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4 style="color:blue">1981: Jobs Becomes Chairman&#45;</h4>
                        <p>Jobs became chairman and Mike Markkula became president. Then in September the company
                            introduced the ProFile hard disk
                            — a 5MB mass storage system that seems like nothing compared to today's storage system
                            capacity. Too put it into
                            perspective, 5MB would be one page of "a" letters, which is about 3,696 characters.
                        </p>
                        <h4 style="color:blue">2007: Apple Makes a Phone&#45;</h4>
                        <p>The iPod was a great innovation, but the iPhone is what really changed the company. In 2007,
                            Jobs introduced the
                            smartphone to the world and decided to change the company's name to just Apple, Inc.
